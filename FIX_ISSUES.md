# Fix for Terraform Apply Workflow Failure

## Problem

The Terraform apply workflow is failing with the following error:

```
Error: Error acquiring the state lock
Error message: operation error DynamoDB: PutItem, https response error
StatusCode: 400, RequestID: RNKF233JH00TDC4PDNMQ15FNRFVV4KQNSO5AEMVJF66Q9ASUAAJG,
ConditionalCheckFailedException: The conditional request failed
Lock Info:
  ID:        8536632e-b54c-0b6e-1697-1679e7de1025
  Path:      ***/kafka-eks-new/terraform.tfstate
  Operation: OperationTypePlan
  Who:       runner@runnervmwhb2z
  Version:   1.9.0
  Created:   2025-10-25 21:03:39.126542529 +0000 UTC
```

This error occurs when Terraform tries to acquire a state lock but finds that a lock already exists in the DynamoDB table.

## Root Cause

The issue is caused by a stale lock entry in the DynamoDB table that was not properly cleaned up when a previous Terraform operation was interrupted or failed.

## Solution

I've implemented several fixes to resolve this issue:

### 1. Enhanced Lock Cleanup in Workflows

Updated both [terraform-apply.yml](.github/workflows/terraform-apply.yml) and [terraform-plan.yml](.github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml) workflows with enhanced lock cleanup steps that:

- Check for multiple types of lock IDs that could be present
- Try to remove locks using different approaches:
  - Direct path from error message: `***/kafka-eks-new/terraform.tfstate`
  - MD5 version: `kafka-eks-new/terraform.tfstate-md5`
  - Direct path: `kafka-eks-new/terraform.tfstate`
- Scan all locks in the table and remove them if permissions allow
- Verify that locks have been successfully removed

### 2. Improved Unlock Scripts

Updated the existing unlock scripts with better handling of different lock ID formats:

- [scripts/unlock-terraform.sh](scripts/unlock-terraform.sh) - Enhanced to check and remove multiple lock ID formats
- [scripts/aggressive-unlock.sh](scripts/aggressive-unlock.sh) - Enhanced to handle the specific lock ID from the error

### 3. New Specific Fix Script

Created a new script [scripts/fix-terraform-apply-lock.sh](scripts/fix-terraform-apply-lock.sh) that specifically targets the lock ID mentioned in the error message.

### 4. Updated Documentation

Updated the [TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md](TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md) with specific instructions for this issue.

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Run the Specific Fix Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export TF_STATE_TABLE=terraform-locks
export TF_STATE_BUCKET=my-terraform-state-kafka-eks-12345

# Run the specific fix script
./scripts/fix-terraform-apply-lock.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix

```bash
# Remove the specific lock causing the issue
aws dynamodb delete-item --table-name terraform-locks --key '{"LockID": {"S": "***/kafka-eks-new/terraform.tfstate"}}'

# Also remove the MD5 version
aws dynamodb delete-item --table-name terraform-locks --key '{"LockID": {"S": "kafka-eks-new/terraform.tfstate-md5"}}'

# Verify the locks have been removed
aws dynamodb get-item --table-name terraform-locks --key '{"LockID": {"S": "***/kafka-eks-new/terraform.tfstate"}}'
aws dynamodb get-item --table-name terraform-locks --key '{"LockID": {"S": "kafka-eks-new/terraform.tfstate-md5"}}'
```

### Option 3: Use the Existing Unlock Scripts

```bash
# Run the enhanced unlock script
./scripts/unlock-terraform.sh

# Or run the aggressive unlock script
./scripts/aggressive-unlock.sh
```

## Prevention

The updated workflows now include enhanced lock cleanup steps that should automatically handle this issue in the future. The workflows will:

1. Check for existing locks before running Terraform commands
2. Attempt to remove multiple types of lock IDs
3. Clean local Terraform state
4. Verify that locks have been removed

This should prevent the issue from recurring in future runs.
