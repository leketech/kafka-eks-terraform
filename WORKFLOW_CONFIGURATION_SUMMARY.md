# Workflow Configuration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the GitHub Actions workflow configuration for the Kafka EKS Terraform project and confirms that all workflows are correctly configured to run in the proper sequence.

## Workflow Sequence

The workflows are designed to run in a specific sequence:

1. **Terraform Plan** ([terraform-plan.yml](.github/workflows/terraform-plan.yml)) - Creates infrastructure plans
2. **Terraform Apply** ([terraform-apply.yml](.github/workflows/terraform-apply.yml)) - Applies infrastructure changes
3. **Deploy Kafka** ([kafka-deploy.yml](.github/workflows/kafka-deploy.yml)) - Deploys Kafka on the infrastructure

## Workflow Details

### 1. Terraform Plan Workflow
- **Trigger**: Pull requests to main/master branches, pushes to main/master with terraform file changes, manual trigger
- **Purpose**: Creates a plan of infrastructure changes without applying them
- **Output**: Plan is reviewed in PR comments before merging

### 2. Terraform Apply Workflow
- **Trigger**: Pushes to main branch, manual trigger
- **Purpose**: Applies the approved infrastructure changes
- **Prerequisite**: Successful plan review and merge to main
- **Output**: Actual infrastructure changes are made in AWS

### 3. Deploy Kafka Workflow
- **Trigger**: Successful completion of Terraform Apply workflow, manual trigger
- **Purpose**: Deploys Kafka cluster on the newly created infrastructure
- **Prerequisite**: Successful completion of Terraform Apply workflow
- **Output**: Running Kafka cluster with Strimzi operator

## Validation Results

### Secret Configuration
✅ All required secrets are properly configured:
- `TF_STATE_BUCKET`: my-terraform-state-kafka-eks-12345
- `TF_STATE_LOCK_TABLE`: terraform-locks

### AWS Access
✅ AWS credentials are valid and have the necessary permissions

### Backend Resources
✅ S3 bucket is accessible
✅ DynamoDB table is accessible

### Workflow Triggers
✅ Workflows are correctly configured to trigger in sequence:
- Terraform Apply triggers Deploy Kafka on successful completion
- Manual triggers available for all workflows

## Correct Execution Sequence

To properly deploy the infrastructure and Kafka cluster:

1. Make changes in a feature branch
2. Create a Pull Request to main branch
3. Terraform Plan workflow automatically runs
4. Review the plan in PR comments
5. Merge the Pull Request to main branch
6. Terraform Apply workflow automatically runs
7. Deploy Kafka workflow automatically runs after successful apply

## Troubleshooting

If workflows don't trigger automatically:
1. Check that the previous workflow completed successfully
2. Verify workflow names match exactly
3. Use manual triggers if needed
4. Check GitHub Actions logs for error details

## Conclusion

All workflows are correctly configured and can be deployed in the proper sequence. The triggering mechanism between Terraform Apply and Deploy Kafka workflows is working as expected. The recent fix for the Terraform state lock issue ensures that the workflows should now run without interruption.
